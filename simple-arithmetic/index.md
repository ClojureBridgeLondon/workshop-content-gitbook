# Working with Numbers

A number can be represented in Clojure just like you would do in the English language, `10`, `42`, `3.143977957`, `2/3`.

## Simple Arithmetic - using functions

Arithmetic (adding, subtraction, multiplication, division) is the same principle as you learnt at school.

Clojure uses functions (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) followed by the numbers that function will work with.

```clojure
(+ 1 2 3)
(- 10 4 3 2)
(* 7 3 2)
(/ 44 2 7)
```
