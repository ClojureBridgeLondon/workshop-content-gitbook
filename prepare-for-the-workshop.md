# Prepare For The Workshop

> #### Danger::Workshop does not save your code
> The Clojure REPL in this workshop does not save any code you write once you leave a page, or if you refresh the page.


## Saving your code in repl.it

[repl.it](https://repl.it/) is a Cloud development environment.  [Create a free account](https://repl.it/signup) to save the code you write to solve challenges from the ClojureBridge London workshop.

repl.it also lets you share your code with other students (or anyone else) via a simple repl.it link.  The link presents your code in a REPL so those you share with can easily run your code and experiment with it.
