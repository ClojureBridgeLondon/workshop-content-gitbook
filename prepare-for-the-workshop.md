# Prepare For The Workshop

> #### Danger::Workshop does not save your code
> The Clojure REPL in this workshop does not save any code you write once you leave a page, or if you refresh the page.


## Saving your code in repl.it

[repl.it](https://repl.it/) is a Cloud development environment.  If you [create a free account](https://repl.it/signup) you can save code you write to solve challenges from the ClojureBridge London workshop.

repl.it also lets you share your code (and the REPL) so anyone can experiment with you code.
