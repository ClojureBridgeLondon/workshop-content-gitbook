# Prepare For The Workshop

If you wish to keep your own code examples from this workshop, you should create a clojure project.

> #### Danger::Workshop does not save your code
> This workshop has a built-in Clojure REPL that lets you write and evaluate code directly in the web pages.  Any code written in a page is not kept once you leave a page, or if you refresh the page.

<hr />

> #### Note::Create a project & open the core.clj file
> Use the Clojure build tool called Leiningen to create a new project
```bash
lein new playground
```
> In your Clojure editor, open the file: `src/playground/core.clj`

<hr />

> #### Hint::Links to Editor setup guides
> By setting up a Clojure editor, you can save your Clojure code in files or projects for review after the workshop.
>
> There are several editors you can choose from:
>
> * [LightTable](https://github.com/ClojureBridgeLondon/curriculum/blob/gh-pages/outline/setup.md) - great for those new to Clojure (default choice)
> * [Spacemacs](https://practicalli.github.io/spacemacs/install-spacemacs/) or [Emacs & Cider](https://cider.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/) - for developers that love Emacs & Vim
> * [Atom & Protorepl](https://atom.io/packages/proto-repl#installation) - typically used by web & Javascript developers
> * [IntelliJ & Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com/userguide/) - typically used by Java developers
