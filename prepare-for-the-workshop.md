# Prepare For The Workshop

> #### Danger::Workshop does not save your code
> This workshop has a built-in Clojure REPL that lets you write and evaluate code directly in the web pages.  Any code written in a page is not kept once you leave a page, or if you refresh the page.
>
> If you wish to keep your own code examples from this workshop, you should create a clojure project.

## Development setup guide

By setting up a [Clojure development environment](https://github.com/ClojureBridgeLondon/curriculum/blob/gh-pages/outline/setup.md) you can save your Clojure code in files or projects for review after the workshop.  You can also create your own projects and take your Clojure practice further.

You will need

* **Java standard edition (SE)** - Clojure runs on top of Java.  The Java Runtime Enviromment (JRE) is needed to run Clojure .
* **Leiningen** - a tool for running Clojure programs, also creating & managing Clojure projects
* **Git** - versioning your Clojure code (so you can go back to earlier versions if you make a mistake)
* **A Clojure aware Editor** - one of several editor choices that support the Clojure programming language

> #### Hint::
> If you just wish to save your code, you can use any editor you prefer or paste it into [Github gists](https://gist.github.com/)


### Clojure aware editors

There are several editors that support Clojure development:

> #### Hint::
> If you are new to development of any kind, then we suggest [LightTable](https://github.com/ClojureBridgeLondon/curriculum/blob/gh-pages/outline/setup.md)


* [LightTable](https://github.com/ClojureBridgeLondon/curriculum/blob/gh-pages/outline/setup.md) - great for those new to Clojure (default choice)
* [Atom & Protorepl](https://atom.io/packages/proto-repl#installation) - typically used by web & Javascript developers
* [Emacs](https://cider.readthedocs.io/) - for developers that love Emacs
* [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) - for developers that love Emacs & Vim ([Spacemacs & Clojure book](https://practicalli.github.io/spacemacs/install-spacemacs/) - work in progress)
* [IntelliJ & Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com/userguide/) - typically used by Java developers
* [Microsoft Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [clojureVScode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=avli.clojure) or [Clojure Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jamesnorton.continuum) plugins
