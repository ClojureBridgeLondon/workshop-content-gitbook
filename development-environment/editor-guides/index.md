# Clojure Editor options

There are several editors that can be used for Clojure development.  You only need one editor and the Leiningen build tool.

> #### Hint::
> If you are new to development of any kind, then we suggest [LightTable](lighttable/)


To help you decide which editor is right for you, here is an overview:

| Editor                     | Level                     | Developer Audience   | Description                                                                                                              |
