# Clojure development environment guides

Coaches can help you set up development tools on your laptop if you wish to continue discovering Clojure after the ClojureBridge London event.

## Common tools required

| Tool            | Is it installed? | Install guide     |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Java 8 or above | `java -version`  | Java install      |
| Leiningen       | `lein version`   | Leiningen install |
| Git             | `git --version`  | Git install       |

Clojure is a hosted language and runs on top of Java or JavaScript (and other platforms).  The Java Runtime Enviromment (JRE) is needed to run Clojure.

Leiningen is a build tool for running Clojure code, creating and managing projects.

Git can be used to version your Clojure code, so you can go back to earlier versions if you make a mistake.


## Clojure aware editors

Use one of the following editors

* [Atom.io](https://atom.io/) and the [protoREPL](https://atom.io/packages/proto-repl#installation) package - typically used by web & Javascript developers
* [Emacs](https://cider.readthedocs.io/) - for developers that love Emacs
* [Microsoft VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Calva](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cospaia.clojure4vscode) extension.
* [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) - for developers that love Emacs & Vim ([Spacemacs & Clojure book](https://practicalli.github.io/spacemacs/install-spacemacs/) - work in progress)
* [IntelliJ & Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com/userguide/) - typically used by Java developers
* [LightTable](https://github.com/ClojureBridgeLondon/curriculum/blob/gh-pages/outline/setup.md) - great for those new to Clojure (default choice)


> #### Hint:: Just saving your code
> If you just wish to save your code, you can use any editor you prefer or paste it into [Github gists](https://gist.github.com/)
