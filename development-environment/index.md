# Clojure development environment guides

If you wish to continue discovering Clojure after the ClojureBridge London event, we can help you set up development tools on your laptop.

You will need:

* **Java standard edition (SE)** - Clojure runs on top of Java.  The Java Runtime Enviromment (JRE) is needed to run Clojure .
* **Leiningen** - a tool for running Clojure programs, also creating & managing Clojure projects
* **Git** - versioning your Clojure code (so you can go back to earlier versions if you make a mistake)
* **A Clojure aware Editor** - one of several editor choices that support the Clojure programming language

> #### Hint::
> If you just wish to save your code, you can use any editor you prefer or paste it into [Github gists](https://gist.github.com/)


## Clojure aware editors

There are several editors that support Clojure development:

* [LightTable](https://github.com/ClojureBridgeLondon/curriculum/blob/gh-pages/outline/setup.md) - great for those new to Clojure (default choice)
* [Atom & Protorepl](https://atom.io/packages/proto-repl#installation) - typically used by web & Javascript developers
* [Emacs](https://cider.readthedocs.io/) - for developers that love Emacs
* [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) - for developers that love Emacs & Vim ([Spacemacs & Clojure book](https://practicalli.github.io/spacemacs/install-spacemacs/) - work in progress)
* [IntelliJ & Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com/userguide/) - typically used by Java developers
* [Microsoft Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [clojureVScode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=avli.clojure) or [Clojure Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jamesnorton.continuum) plugins

> If you are new to development of any kind, then we suggest [LightTable](https://github.com/ClojureBridgeLondon/curriculum/blob/gh-pages/outline/setup.md)
