# Flow Control

* Boolean logic
* `if`
* `cond`

## Making Decisions

Flow control is the programming term for deciding how to act to a given circumstance. We make decisions like this all the time.

*If* it's a nice day out,
  *then* we should visit the park;
  *otherwise* we should stay inside and play board games.

*If* your car's tank is nearly empty,
  *then* you should visit a gas station;
  *otherwise* you should continue to your destination.

*If* you want to have a fun time learning to code,
  *then* you should attend ClojureBridge London;

There does not always need to ben an *otherwise*


## Testing conditions to react

Software is also full of these decisions. *If* the user's input is valid, *then* we should save their data; *otherwise* we show an error message.

The common pattern here is that you test some condition and react differently based on whether the condition is *true* or *false*.


## Boolean Values

*true* or *false* are referred to as boolean values or [boolean data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type)
