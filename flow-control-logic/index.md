# Flow Control

* `if`
* `cond`
* Boolean logic

## Decisions how to react

Flow control is the programming term for deciding how to react to a given circumstance. We make decisions like this all the time.

*If* it's a nice day out, 
  *then* we should visit the park; 
  *otherwise* we should stay inside and play board games. 

*If* your car's tank is empty, 
  *then* you should visit a gas station; 
  *otherwise* you should continue to your destination.

## Testing conditions to react

Software is also full of these decisions. *If* the user's input is valid, *then* we should save their data; *otherwise* we show an error message. 

The common pattern here is that you test some condition and react differently based on whether the condition is *true* or *false*.
