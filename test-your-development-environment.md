# Test your development environment

> #### Note::Create a project & open the code
> Use the Clojure build tool called Leiningen to create a new project
```bash
lein new playground
```
> In your Clojure editor, open the file: `src/playground/core.clj`


## Run the REPL

> ####Hint::What is the REPL?
> The REPL is a tool that runs your code and returns results.  More details later, in the section: [what is a repl?](introducing-clojure/what-is-a-repl.html)

To run your code we use a tool called the REPL (Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop).  Check you can run your code using the repl with one of these methods

* On the command line with [lein repl]
* LightTable
* Atom / Protorepl
* Spacemacs
* IntelliJ / Cursive
* Microsoft Code
