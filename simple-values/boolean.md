# Boolean (true or false) 

A boolean is a true or false value, and you type them just like that,
`true` and `false`. 

Often in programming, we need to ask a true or false question, like:

* "Is this class in the current semester?"
* "Is this person's birthday today?" 

When we ask those questions, we get a boolean value returned.

> #### Hint:: 
> There is another value `nil`, which behaves like a boolean in terms of __truthiness__.
>
> But, `nil` means no value at all and not a boolean

```clojure
true
false
nil
```

> #### Note::Evaluate the Boolean values in the REPL
> Type a string into the REPL to see what is returned.
```eval-clojure
false
```
