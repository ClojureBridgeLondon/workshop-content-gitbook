# EXERCISE 1: Basic arithmetic

Some simple arithmetic to help you see how much Clojure you have learnt already.

> #### Note::Workshop Minutes Elapsed
> How many seconds have elapsed since you arrived at the workshop today?
> You might first want to calculate the minutes elapsed
```eval-clojure
()
```

<hr />


> #### Note::Convert Seconds back to Minutes & Seconds
> Convert the workshop time elapsed fron seconds to minutes and seconds.
> The minutes and the seconds should be separate numbers.
>
> `(quot x y)` will give you the whole number part of x divided by y.
> `(rem x y)` will give you the remainder of x divided by y.
```eval-clojure
()
```
