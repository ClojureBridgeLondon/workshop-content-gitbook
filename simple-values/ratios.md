# Ratios 

Finally, we have fractions, which are also called ratios. Computers cannot perfectly represent all floats, but ratios are always exact. We write them with a slash, like so:

```eval-clojure
1/2
-7/3
```

> #### Note::Evaluate some Integer values in the REPL
> Type some ratios (fractions) into the REPL to see what is returned
```eval-clojure
22/7
```

> #### Hint::
> Just like with pen-and-paper math, the [denominator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_%28mathematics%29) of your ratio cannot be equal to `0`.
