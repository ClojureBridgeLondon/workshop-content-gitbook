# Numbers

Clojure has several different types of numbers.

* [Integer numbers](integers.html) (whole numbers)
* [Decimal numbers](decimals.html) (floating point numbers)
* [Ratios](ratios.html) (fractions)

Hopefully you recognise these types of numbers from your daily life.

We can use these numbers for some simple arithmetic, which we will also practice later in this section.


> #### Hint::
> Integers are a simple example of Immutable values.  Once you create an Integer, you cannot change it.
>
> It would be a funny world if you could change the value of 1 so that it equalled 2
