# Simple Values

In order to do anything in a programming language, you need to have values to work with. In Clojure, simple values are numbers, strings, booleans, nil and keywords.

* Numbers
  - Basic Arithmetic
  - Prefix Notation
* Strings
* Booleans and nil
  - Testing Truthiness
* Keywords

We will also look at how to assign a name to a simple value:

* Assignment: `def`
  - Assigning expressions

To put this all together there is a [basic arithmetic exercise](exercise-1-basic-arithmetic.html).
