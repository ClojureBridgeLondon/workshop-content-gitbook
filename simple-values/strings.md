# Strings

What is a string? A string is just a piece of text. To make a string, you enclose it in quotation marks.

* Reference: [String](http://clojurebridge.github.io/community-docs/docs/clojure/string/)

Look at the last example. A backslash is how we put a quotation mark inside a string. Do not try using single quotes to make a string.


```clojure
"Hello, World!"
"This is a longer string that I wrote for purposes of an example."
"Aubrey said, \"I think we should go to the Orange Julius.\""
```

> #### Note::Evaluate some String values in the REPL
> Type a string into the REPL to see what is returned.  
>
> Ensure you use double quotes to surround your string.
```eval-clojure
"My favourite programming language is..."
```

> #### Hint::
> Be careful when copy/pasting Clojure code from a website that uses the stylised double quotes.  These stylised quotes are actually a different character, so your string would not evaluate correctly.
