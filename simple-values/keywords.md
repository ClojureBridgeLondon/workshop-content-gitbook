# Keywords

Keywords are the strangest of the basic value types, they donâ€™t have a real world analog like numbers, strings, or booleans.

For now you can think of them as a special type of string, but has more super powers that we will cover in maps.


```clojure
:forename
:surname
:date-of-birth
```

> #### Note::Evaluate some Keyword values in the REPL
> Type a keyword into the REPL to see what is returned.
>
> Ensure you start your keyword with a colon, `:`
```eval-clojure
:i-am-a-keyword
```

> #### Hint::
> Keywords should make more sense when we start looking at the `map` data structure in Clojure
