# Integers

First up are integers. 

Integers include zero, the positive whole numbers, and the negative whole numbers.

You write them just like we do in every day life.

```clojure
0
12
-42
```

> #### Note::Evaluate some Integer values in the REPL
> Type some numbers (Integers) into the REPL to see what is returned
