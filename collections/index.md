# Collections

A collection is a group of values

Example collections:
* your library of music on Spotify (or other music streaming service)
* clothes in your wardrobe or shoe collection
* co-ordinates on a map for a hiking route, including height & type of terrain and weather over time

Clojure has **four** collections that are built into the language.

> #### Hint::
> Vectors and Maps are the most common data structures used in Clojure for defining and working with values.
>
> Data structures in Clojure are used instead of defining your own types (which you would do in a language like Java, C++, Scala, etc.)
