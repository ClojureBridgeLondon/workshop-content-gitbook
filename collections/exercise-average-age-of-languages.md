# Exercise: Programming language ages revisited

Lets take the [programming language ages exercise](/simple-values/exercise-age-of-languages.html) and use a collection for the ages.  Does this change how we work with the numbers?

The programming language ages in a vector collection:

`[10 27 26 21 22 22 45 34 59 60]`.

------------------------------------------

```eval-clojure
()
```

<!--sec data-title="Reveal answer..." data-id="answer003" data-collapse=true ces-->

```clojure
(first (sort [10 27 26 21 22 22 45 34 59 60]))
```

The [min](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/min) function will simplify our expression but we need to pass the individual numbers

```clojure
(min 10 27 26 21 22 22 45 34 59 60)
```

To use `min` with the vector collection, we would need to use the `apply` function and give `min` and the vector as its arguments.

The `apply` function essentially re-writes the code so that every element in the vector becomes an argument to the `min` function.

```clojure
(apply min [10 27 26  21 22 22 45 34 59 60])

;; becomes

(min 10 27 26 21 22 22 45 34 59 60)
```

There are over 600 functions in `clojure.core` so there is often a function you are looking for to simplify you code
