## EXERCISE: Modelling People


> #### Note::Model Yourself
Make a map representing yourself, using only the information about yourself you want to share.
> 
> Example information could include: your first name and last names, where you grew up, favourite food.
> 
> Add some information directly to the map, then use [assoc](http://grimoire.arrdem.com/1.6.0/clojure.core/assoc/) or [merge](http://grimoire.arrdem.com/1.6.0/clojure.core/merge/) to add more.
```eval-clojure

> #### Note::[BONUS]: Model your classmates
> Use the map you made about yourself in previous exercise.
>
> Create a vector of maps containing the first name, last name and hometown of two or three other classmates around you.
>
> Add your map to their information using [conj](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/conj).
