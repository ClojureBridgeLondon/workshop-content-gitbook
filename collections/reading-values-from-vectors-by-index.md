# Reading values from a Vector by Index

We can read values in a vector by the index, the location each value is in the vector, starting from zero.

The `nth` function gives us the value at a specific location in the vector.

```clojure
(nth [5 10 15] 1)
;=> 10
```


## How many values in our vector
`count` gives us the number of items in a vector.


> #### Note::Extracting values from vectors
> Create some vectors and count the values in a vector
```eval-clojure
()
```
