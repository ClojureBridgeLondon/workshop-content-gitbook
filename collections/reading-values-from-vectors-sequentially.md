# Reading values from a Vector Sequentially

We can read values in a vector sequentially, eg. one after the other, using the functions `first`, `second`, `last` and `rest`.

> #### Note::Get specific values from a vector
> Use the `first`, `second`, `last` and `rest` functions to read values from a vector, for example `[1 2 "three" [4 5] :emoji-smile]`
```eval-clojure
()
```

You can also combine these functions, so the results of one function call can be used by another function call.


> #### Note::How do we get just the third value in a vector?
> Using any of the functions `first`, `second`, `rest`, how to we get the **third** value from the vector `["Birthdays are" "full of" "presents" "that you" "always dreamd" "of having"]`
```eval-clojure
()
```

------------------------------------------

> #### Hint::
>  These functions also work with a list too.
