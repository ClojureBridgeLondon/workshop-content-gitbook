Welcome to ClojureBridge London, a community-driven event that provides a safe space for learning and supporting people under-represented in the software industry.

Following this workshop will give you your first taste of Functional Programming with the Clojure programming language.  We hope you continue your experiences with other [London Clojurians](http://www.londonclojurians.org/) community events.
