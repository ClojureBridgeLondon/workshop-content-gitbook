## Colours and Shapes in Clojure

A visual way to learn how to write code by creating and interacting with shapes.  From simply adding colours to creating multiple shapes and colours and creating simple animations.

* Simple values (numbers, characters, strings)
* Assignment (naming things)
* Collections of values
* Functions
* Flow Control flow
* Iteration
* Challenges or Projects

## Guided projects

* [Celebrity Name Smash](additional-projects/celebrity-name-smash.html) - string manipulation: subs count, take, str, lazy sequence, apply, reduce
* [Most common word](https://clojurebridgelondon.github.io/community-docs/docs/curriculum/most-common-word) - find the most common word in a book (not including common English language words, like 'the')
* [Clacks messages](additional-projects/clacks-messages.html) - simple encoding & decoding of messages, thinking about data structures: maps (key value pairs), get, map reduce  (extension of the map reduce sandwich)


## Challenges

Explore your own solutions to the following challenges
