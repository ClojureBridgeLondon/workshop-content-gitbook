# ClojureBridge Workshop Overview

Thank you for joining us.

The audience for these workshops is diverse, so we provide a range examples and projects to help you do something you can relate too.  This does of course mean that there is more content than anyone can cover in one day.

> #### Info::
> You should have a Clojure environment set up from our event on Friday evening. If you missed this, please get in touch with a volunteer to help you get setup.

## Outline for the day

The morning covers the language syntax of Clojure, so you can speak Clojure to your computer, along with some of the core concepts of thinking functionally.

* Simple values (numbers, characters, strings)
* Assignment (naming things)
* Collections of values
* Functions
* Flow Control flow
* Iteration
* Challenges or Projects


## Guided projects

* [Celebrity Name Smash](additional-projects/celebrity-name-smash.html) - string manipulation: subs count, take, str, lazy sequence, apply, reduce
* [Most common word](https://clojurebridgelondon.github.io/community-docs/docs/curriculum/most-common-word) - find the most common word in a book (not including common English language words, like 'the')
* [Clacks messages](additional-projects/clacks-messages.html) - simple encoding & decoding of messages, thinking about data structures: maps (key value pairs), get, map reduce  (extension of the map reduce sandwich)


## Challenges

Explore your own solutions to the following challenges

* [4Clojure Challenges](http://www.4clojure.com/)
* [Wonderland kata challenges](https://github.com/gigasquid/wonderland-clojure-katas) (inspired by Alice in wonderland)


> ####Hint::How far you get is how far you should have gone
> There is more content here than anyone can cover in a day, so however far you get is the right amount of progress for you.
>
> If you enjoy the day you can of course continue with any topics and challenges you didn't get to as follow-on exercises.
>
> We also welcome you to come along to the [London Clojurian community events](https://www.meetup.com/London-Clojurians/)
