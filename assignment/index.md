# Assignment with `def`

Rather than type the same values many times in our code, we can give them a name to refer to them. This is called assignment.

* `let` for a name we use in one function (local)
* `def` for a name we use with several functions (global)

> When a name is assigned a value, that name is referred to as a *symbol*.
