# What is a REPL?

A REPL is a way to interactively evaluate your code and get instant results.

"REPL" stands for **R**ead, **E**val, **P**rint, **L**oop

* _Read_ - the code is read to see if it is correct.

* _Evaluate_ - the code is compiled into something the computer can understand and run through

* _Print_ - the result is printed to the screen

* _Loop_ - we go back to the start and do it all again

All this happens almost instantly in the REPL, so all you really see is the result printed to the screen.


## Using a REPL in this workshop

For this workshop there is a REPL on each web page.  This uses a Clojure project called Klipse.

Your Clojure aware editor also has a REPL that works in the same way.  You type in code and you can evaluate it.



> #### Hint::
> Most editors also allow you to evaluate code directly in the editor window.
>
> In LightTable you can press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> - <kbd>Enter</kbd> at the end of a line of Clojure code, after the final closed parentheses, `)`.
