# What is Clojure good at?

<!--sec data-title="Data Processing" data-id="answer001" data-collapse=true ces-->

Clojure is known for being good at data processing as it has a great set of data structures built-in to the language.

The data structures are: Lists, Vectors, Maps & Sets 

These data structures provide ways to represent data that are easy to use and powerful.

Clojure is known for its concurrency. 

Think about writing instructions for several of your friends about how to assemble an _Ikea bed_.  Instead of writing them so one step is done at a time, each of your friends does part of the job.

Then, they coordinate at the right time to assemble those parts into bigger
parts, and they do this over and over again until the end, when it
all comes together.

Those instructions would be really complicated, hard to write and probably hard to read, too. 

Clojure gives us some easy ways to write these sorts of instructions for computers.
