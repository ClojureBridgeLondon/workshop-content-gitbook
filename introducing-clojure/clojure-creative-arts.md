# Clojure: Creative Arts

## Music

* [Klangmeister](https://ctford.github.io/klangmeister/) - design synthesisers and compose music using Clojure in a live coding environment in the browser
* [Overtone](http://overtone.github.io/) - explore new musical ideas from synthesis and sampling to instrument building within a collaborative jamming live-coding environment. Combines the powerful [SuperCollider audio engine](http://supercollider.github.io/) with Clojure
    * [A live coding environment for Overtone and Leipzig.](https://github.com/pjagielski/disclojure)
    * [Overtone Recipes - programming music with Clojure](http://overtone-recipes.github.io/)
    * MetaX - [Hack Your Own Band With Clojure and Overtone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUU7WeUiR5o#t=51m44s)
    * [Chris Ford - Creating music with Clojure and Overtone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYZeQ6t_5SA#t55m.18s)
    * [Live coding with Overtone and disclojure - Piotr Jagielski](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsLnOiepq0GEPpGY14V5Rg)

## IOT / Lightshows

* [Afterglow](https://github.com/brunchboy/afterglow) live coding for the creation of algorithmic light shows in Clojure using the Open Lighting Architecture, ola-clojure, wayang, beat-link, and pieces of the Overtone toolkit.  See the [presentation from Clojure Madison meetup, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvNN0SMMZDQ)


## Graphics

Images are just data (numbers) that your application does something visual with.

Modern graphical images are described as 2D or 3D co-ordinates (points in space).  Paths are drawn along these points to make an infinite number of shapes, just like a join the dots puzzle.

Animation is simply multiple images drawn or displayed one after the other.


#### Example graphics libraries

* [Quil](http://quil.info/) - generate 2D graphics and animations.  One of the ClojureBridge projects is  Turtle, helping you understand the basics of using functions.
    * [Quil Examples](http://quil.info/examples)
* [Thi.ng](http://thi.ng/) - an open source collection of 20+ computational design tools for Clojure & Clojurescript.


### Example applications

* [Goya](https://jackschaedler.github.io/goya/) - a web application for creating pixel base images
