# Clojure: Creative Arts

## Music

* [Klangmeister](https://ctford.github.io/klangmeister/) - design synthesisers and compose music using Clojure in a live coding environment in the browser
* [Overtone](http://overtone.github.io/) - explore new musical ideas from synthesis and sampling to instrument building within a collaborative jamming live-coding environment. Combines the powerful [SuperCollider audio engine](http://supercollider.github.io/) with Clojure
    * MetaX - [Hack Your Own Band With Clojure and Overtone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUU7WeUiR5o#t=51m44s)

## Graphics

Images are just data (numbers) that your application does something visual with.

Modern graphical images are described as 2D or 3D co-ordinates (points in space).  Paths are drawn along these points to make an infinite number of shapes, just like a join the dots puzzle.

Animation is simply multiple images drawn or displayed one after the other.


#### Example graphics libraries

* [Quil](http://quil.info/) - generate 2D graphics and animations.  One of the ClojureBridge projects is  Turtle, helping you understand the basics of using funcitons.
    * [Quil Examples](http://quil.info/examples)
* [Thi.ng](http://thi.ng/) - an open source collection of 20+ computational design tools for Clojure & Clojurescript.


### Example applications

* [Goya](https://jackschaedler.github.io/goya/) - a web application for creating pixel base images
