## Graphics

Modern graphical images are described as 2D or 3D co-ordinates (points in space).

Paths are drawn along these points to make an infinite number of shapes, just like a join the dots puzzle.

So images are just data (numbers) that your application does something visual with.

Animation is simply multiple images drawn or displayed one after the other.


#### Example graphics libraries

* [Quil](https://quil.info) - generate 2D graphics and animations.  One of the ClojureBridge projects is  Turtle, helping you understand the basics of using funcitons.

* [Thi.ng](http://thi.ng/) - an open source collection of 20+ computational design tools for Clojure & Clojurescript.


### Example applications

* [Goya](https://jackschaedler.github.io/goya/) - a web application for creating pixel base images
