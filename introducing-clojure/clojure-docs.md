# Viewing Clojure docs in LightTable

> #### Note::Toggle the Clojure docs
> Understand what a Clojure function does by viewing the documentation for a specific function
>
> * Go to either of `insta-REPL` or `walk.clj` file
>
> * Right click on a function name and select **Show docs**
>
> The document appears in LightTable for that function
>
> * Right click on the same function name and select **Show docs** again
> 
> See the documentation for that function now disappears

> #### Hint::
> [Clojure Docs website](https://clojuredocs.org/) contains descriptions of all the core Clojure functions, along with examples on how to use each function.
