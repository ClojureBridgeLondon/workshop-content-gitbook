# Welcome to ClojureBridge project

We have created an example Clojure project called "Welcome To ClojureBridge" to test your development tools.

{% tabs projectzip="Download project as zip file", projectclone="Clone project from Github" %}

{% content "projectzip" %}
[Download the "Welcome To ClojureBridge" zip file](https://github.com/ClojureBridgeLondon/welcometoclojurebridge/archive/master.zip) and extract all the files.


{% content "projectclone" %}
If you are comfortable using the git version control tool and the command line, then you can clone the project using git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ClojureBridge/welcometoclojurebridge
```

{% endtabs %}
