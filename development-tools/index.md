# Development Environment for Clojure

The ClojureBridge London workshop can be completed without a Clojure environment, however none of your work is saved.

If you want to continue working with Clojure, we can help you set up a Clojure environment

A typical Clojure environment consists of

* Java - usually installed on laptops by default
* Leiningen - for creating and running Clojure projects
* A Clojure aware editor



## Clojure aware editors

There are several editors that support Clojure development:

> #### Hint::
> If you are new to development of any kind, then we suggest [LightTable](https://github.com/ClojureBridgeLondon/curriculum/blob/gh-pages/outline/setup.md)


* [LightTable](https://github.com/ClojureBridgeLondon/curriculum/blob/gh-pages/outline/setup.md) - great for those new to Clojure (default choice)
* [Atom & Protorepl](https://atom.io/packages/proto-repl#installation) - typically used by web & Javascript developers
* [Emacs](https://cider.readthedocs.io/) - for developers that love Emacs
* [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) - for developers that love Emacs & Vim ([Spacemacs & Clojure book](https://practicalli.github.io/spacemacs/install-spacemacs/) - work in progress)
* [IntelliJ & Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com/userguide/) - typically used by Java developers
* [Microsoft Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [clojureVScode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=avli.clojure) or [Clojure Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jamesnorton.continuum) plugins
