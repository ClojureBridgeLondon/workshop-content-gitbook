# Colours and Shapes

The [Colours and Shapes in Clojure learning path](https://www.maria.cloud/gist/9afbc2adf3638f1bcf6a6c08b6f33226) uses an interactive website called Maria.cloud.  It lets you write code and see the results straight away.  You can also make your own note and save them once you have taken a copy.

> ####Hint::Requirements
> We will ask you to login to Maria.cloud with your GitHub account.
>
> Please [create a free GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you do not already have one.


## Sign-in to Maria.cloud

Open the [Maria.cloud website](https://www.maria.cloud/) and sign-in using the same GitHub account.

You may be prompted to authorize Maria.cloud access to your GitHub account.  This is safe (and can be revoked after the event)
