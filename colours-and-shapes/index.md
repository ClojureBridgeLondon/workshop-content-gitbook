# Colours and Shapes

The [Colours and Shapes in Clojure learning path](https://www.maria.cloud/gist/9afbc2adf3638f1bcf6a6c08b6f33226) uses an interactive website called Maria.cloud.  It lets you write code and see the results straight away.  You can also make your own note and save them once you have taken a copy.
