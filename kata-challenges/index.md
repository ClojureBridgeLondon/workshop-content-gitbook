# Kata Challenges

A coding kata is a simple exercise that helps you practice your coding skills.  Each challenge can be done in many different ways, so they are great for experimenting with the language you are learning.

Coding kata are also useful for practicing the art of writing tests.  Ideally you write a failing test, then write the code to make the test pass, then write another test, etc.

## Suggested Kata exercise

* [Recent Song Playlist](recent-song-playlist.html) - a unique list of the songs you have recently played
* [Wonderland kata challenges](https://github.com/gigasquid/wonderland-clojure-katas) (inspired by Alice in wonderland)
* [4Clojure Challenges](http://www.4clojure.com/)

Before starting a kata challenge, take a look at the next pages that cover writing Clojure tests.
