# Alternative workshop material

> #### Warning::Under development
> The alternative workshop material is under active development

From this point on is a proposed re-working of the workshop material.

The new content is still aimed at beginners to programming as well as those with a little coding experience.

The main aim is to maximise the practical exercises and minimise the theory (without over-simplifying the topics).

Specific aims include:

* Replacing quil examples (or at least hiding state & other complexity)
* Identifying fun ways to introduce functional concepts (eg. map reduce sandwich)
* Identifying exercises to add
* Creating an example that can be used throughout the course (eg, a profile app)
* Identifying exercises to remove / replace (eg. examples with mutable state)
* Discussing if testing & TDD should be included, reviewing examples
* Having a set of failing tests (commented) and write code to pass the tests
* Identifying coding kata that could be useful to add (eg most recent list)
* Building something similar to that which you would do in industry
* Any other related ideas welcome
