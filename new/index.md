# Alternative workshop material

> #### Warning::Under development
> The alternative workshop material is under active development

From this point on is a proposed re-working of the workshop material.

The new content is still aimed at beginners to programming as well as those with a little coding experience.

The main aim is to maximise the practical exercises and minimise the theory (without over-simplifying the topics).

Supporting aims include:
- replacing quil examples
- establishing a consistent project throughout the workshop
- building something similar to that which you would do in industry
