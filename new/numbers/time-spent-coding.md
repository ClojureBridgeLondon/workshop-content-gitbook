If you have been coding for a year then you could use:

* `1` to represent one year
* `12` to represent a years worth of months
* `52` to represent a whole year of weeks


What if you have been interested for 6 months, we could use a decimal number

* `0.5` years (decimal number)

or sticking with Integer numbers we can use

* `26` weeks
* `6` months
