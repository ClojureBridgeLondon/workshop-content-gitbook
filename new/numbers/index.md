# Numbers

Numbers in Clojure are just like numbers in the real world.

You write numbers just as you would write them down in a text book or an email.

Numbers can be one of three different types

* Integers - whole numbers
* Decimals - 
* Ratios - fractions as a value





# Ratios

What if we need to used fractions?

* 6/12 (six out of 12)
* 1/2 (six divided by 12)

Clojure can represent fractions using a type called Ratio.  This is a valid number and not a mathematical calculation.
