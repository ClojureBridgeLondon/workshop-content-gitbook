## Vector Syntax

Vectors are written using square brackets with any number of pieces
of data inside them, separated by spaces. Here are some examples of
vectors:

```clojure
[1 2 3 4 5]
[56.9 60.2 61.8 63.1 54.3 66.4 66.5 68.1 70.2 69.2 63.1 57.1]
[]
```

> #### Note::Evaluate some vectors in the REPL
> See how you can combine different types of things in a vector
```eval-clojure
[]
```
