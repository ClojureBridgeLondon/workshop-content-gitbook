# Data Structures

So far, we've dealt with discrete pieces of data: one number, one
string, one value. When programming, it is more often the case that
you want to work with groups of data.

Clojure has great facilities for working with these groups, or
*collections*, of data. Not only does it provide four different types
of collections, but it also provides a uniform way to use all of these
collections together.

* [Vectors](vectors.html)
* [Maps](maps.html)
* Lists
* Sets

> #### Hint::
> Vectors and Maps are the most common data structures used in Clojure for defining and working with data, so we will just focus on those.
