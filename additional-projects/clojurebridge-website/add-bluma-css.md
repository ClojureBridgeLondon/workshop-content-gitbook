# Add Bulma CSS library

Bulma is a CSS only framework (no JavaScript) that provides a range of easy to apply styles using meaningful style names.  Its quite lightweight and therefore fast to load along with your website.

Bulma also recommends using FontAwesome library, to add common logos such at GitHub.
