# Alternative project ideas - needs developing


* [Curriculum exercises](https://clojurebridgelondon.github.io/community-docs/docs/curriculum/)

### Other possible exercises (may need some work)
* Paying the restaurant bill
* Monthly budget calculator (food, parties, bills, etc)
* ClojureBridge London event management - register coaches and attendees and try match them up based on skills & experiences (webapp using ring / compojure - alternative to practicalli, webapps ?)
* Currency converter: compare the current value of currencies (given one currency, show its value in one or more other currencies); track currency changes; compare currency changes over time. (find a suitable api with currency data)


#### Clojure web apps
* [Practicalli, Clojure WebApps](http://practicalli.github.io/clojure-webapps/) - Serverside web application with Ring, Compojure and PostgresQL database


#### ClojureScript web apps
* [Tic-tac-toe game]() - create the game using clojurescript and reagent
* Personal Website using reagent
* Social Network profile with friends


#### Graphics with Quil
* [Snowflakes](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/drawing/blob/master/curriculum/create-something.md) Animation
* [Land of Quil](http://landofquil.we-do-fp.berlin/) Several Quil examples you can try out


#### Existing ClojureBridge projects (probably drop)
* [Twinkle Twinkle Little Star](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/tones/blob/master/curriculum/01-piano-chords.md) Making sounds with Overtone
* [Global Growth](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/global-growth) Web app with REST api
* [Caesar Cipher](http://clojurebridge.github.io/community-docs/docs/exercises/caesar-cipher/) Mini exercise of Strings and Characters
* [Turtles Walk](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/welcometoclojurebridge/blob/master/outline/TURTLE-SAMPLES.md) More function study



### Other possible exercises (may need some work)
* Paying the restaurant bill (re-word to make the problem clearer)
* Monthly budget calculator (food, parties, bills, etc)
* ClojureBridge London event management - register coaches and attendees and try match them up based on skills & experiences (webapp using ring / compojure - alternative to practicalli, webapps ?)
* Currency converter: compare the current value of currencies (given one currency, show its value in one or more other currencies); track currency changes; compare currency changes over time. (find a suitable api with currency data)

### Other ideas (advanced)
* managing your favourite songs with Clojure and the Spotify API
