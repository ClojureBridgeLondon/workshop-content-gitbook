# What are functions?

Functions are the parts of your code that do something.  Your functions are where you define the behaviour of your application.

You have already met some functions:

* `count`
* `conj`
* `first`

> #### Todo::Check which functions we have actually used so far


Maths operators are functions too: 

* `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`

## Arguments

Functions can take any number of arguments, from zero to everything.

The arguments of a function are defined in a vector, [].  

The arguments become names for the data passed when calling a function.  Those names can only be used within the function definition itself.

## Functions return a value

A Function always returns a value, even if that value is `nil`.

Always returning a value makes it easy for Clojure to use functions as an argument to another function.
