#  Functions

Functions are the parts of your code that do something.  Your functions are where you define the behaviour of your application.

You have already met some functions: `count`, `conj`, `first`, `rest`

Maths operators are functions too: * `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`

We can write our own functions too.


## Affect behaviour with arguments

Arguments are values given to a function that could change the result of calling the function.


## Functions return a value

A Function always returns a value, even if that value is `nil`.

Always returning a value makes it easy for Clojure to use functions as an argument to another function.
